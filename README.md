1st homework

This assignment was primarily about refactoring code to make it more clear and concise not only to developers but also to search browsers. By using more specific tags (rather than just infinite divs) your code is far more understandable.


There were a few mistakes made in the original code that needed to fixed, such as unnecesary ending tags (ex. </img>) and a broken link. Additionally, much of the CSS could be consolidated into one reference instead of repeating multiple classes with multiple of the same styles. I was able to fix the text from squishing too much when you resize the browser window, however, I could not prevent the aside section from moving.

*****Known bugs: 
    1) Adblock will prevent one of the images from being loaded
    2) The blue aside moves down the page when browser window is resized
